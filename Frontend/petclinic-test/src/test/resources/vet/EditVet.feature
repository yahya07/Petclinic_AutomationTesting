Feature: Edit an existing Vet
  As an admin
  I want to edit existing vets in our pet clinic
  So that I can resolve any error made in their data

    Given I am navigated to the All Veterinarian page
    When  I click edit button the for the first vet
    And   I enter valid data
    Then  The edited vet will be displayed at the end of the vets's list

  Scenario: editing a Vet to have numbers as names
    Given I am navigated to the All Veterinarian page

    And   I fill fields with numbers

  Scenario: editing a Vet with two spaces as names
    Given I am navigated to the All Veterinarian page
    When  I click edit button the for the first vet
    And   I fill fields with two spaces

    When  I click edit button the for the first vet
    And   I clear all data

    Then  save button is disabled
